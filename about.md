At the university programme *[Software Development and Operations (UDM)](https://coursepress.lnu.se/program/utveckling-och-drift-av-mjukvarusystem/)* at the Linnaeus University in Sweden, the students adopt a vast amount of useful tools. The purpose of this site is to be a library of these tools and other links/material acquired during the three years of studies. 

For now, the content is sorted based on the different courses of the program, but that may change in the future when it might be better to sort the material due to subject instead, time will tell...

This project of creating this website was the first (out of three) exam assignments of the course *[1DV022 ClientÂ­based Web Programming](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/klientbaserad-webbprogrammering/)*, November 2018. The main purpose with this exercise was to acquire basic knowledge of how to use CSS preprocessors and static site generators and to write [blog posts]({{ site.url }}/blog) about the subject. Mission accomplished 2018-11-19!
