Are you about to create an entirely static website? Want to avoid using "copy/paste" for the header, footer and menus etc? Then using a static site generator (SSG) could be considered. Due to the fact that the material is static, you get the advantages of speed and security resulting in a robust site that can manage high traffic. 

To create this website, the SSG [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) was used. Once getting over the hurdle of getting started and get acquaint to the different folders, files, templates and the project structure, I found this tool very convenient to work with (given basic HTML and CSS skills). 

To learn this new tool, the Jekyll theme `minima` was used as a template which was modified to create the unique look of this website. This turned out to be an effective way of learning new techniques. Especially appealing was the structure, which was separating the sass files, the layout templates, the HTML snippets (includes) and the post files (written in markdown, which was new to me, also *very* convenient to use).

Apart from working with the sass files, skills were developed by creating a new layout `coursepage.html`, which is a template for the courses. This will facilitate to add new courses (and new course material) to the markdown files in the folder `courses`.
