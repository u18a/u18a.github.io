Computers, robots, processors, algorithms, machines... well, they do a great job completing their tasks fast and accurate. But to live a happy life, we need... **_humans_** (right?)!

If you want to spread the words about the site, and especially the **_people_** bringing the site to life, you can use the file `humans.txt` which should be positioned in the root of the website. Here you have the opportunity to tell the world whatever you want, but the intention is to use it to draw attention to the people behind the sceene. Below, the `humans.txt` used on this site is shown.

<iframe class = "code-text" 
  src="{{ site.url }}/humans.txt"
  width = "600"
  height = "300">
</iframe>

Read more about the initiative humans.txt on [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org/), where it is recommended to add the button
[![logo from humanstxt.org](/assets/humanstxt-isolated-blank.gif "Show human.txt")]({{ site.url }}/humans.txt) and link it to `humans.txt`.
