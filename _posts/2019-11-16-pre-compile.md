Do you know the feeling of infinitly using "copy/paste" when creating CSS? How about the time flying by when trying to find all occurrences in the CSS where you used the color red when the boss tells you that "show me what it looks like if we go with green instead"? Apparently developers got tired of the limitations of CCS, and some of them created programs known as *CSS preprocessers*.

A CSS preprocesser uses its own syntax and generates the CSS  

The CSS of this site has been developed using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

Computers, robots, processors, algorithms, machines... well, they do a great job completing their tasks fast and accurate. But to live a happy life, we need... **_humans_** (right?)!

If you want to spread the words about the site, and especially the **_people_** bringing the site to life, you can use the file `humans.txt` which should be positioned in the root of the website. Here you have the opportunity to tell the world whatever you want, but the intention is to use it to draw attention to the people behind the sceene. Below, the `humans.txt` is shown.

<iframe class = "code-text" 
  src="{{ site.url }}/humans.txt"
  width = "600"
  height = "300">
</iframe>

Read more about the initiative humans.txt on [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org/), where it is recommended to add a on the website.
