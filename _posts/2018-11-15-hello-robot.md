If you want web robots to visit your site you can use the file `robot.txt`. 
On the other hand, if you **_don't_** want them to visit your site you can also use `robot.txt` (but beware, don't trust them to stay away!).

<iframe class = "robot-text" 
  src="{{ site.url }}/robot.txt"
  width = "200"
  height = "100"
>
</iframe>
