You want to know your audience and their opinions and reactions? Make sure to enable your visitors to leave comments! Want your site to make a great first impression? Make sure to add (preferable awesome) [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) information! And don't forget to add a magnificent favicon to your site!

By adding Open Graph information you can define what basic information you want your site to be associated with on social media. You specify different properties in `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` section (which conveniently is a snippet in the `_layout` folder...). The four required properties is `og:title`, `og:type `, `og:image` and `og:url`. Additionally, I chose to add `og:description` to highlight i brief description of the website.

To enable visitors to leave comments was surprisingly easily by using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). So far, to comment seems to work fine, hope that it will continue to do so once the website is published!
