If you want web robots to visit your site you can use the file `robots.txt`. 
On the other hand, if you **_don't_** want them to visit your site you can also use `robots.txt` (but beware, don't trust the evil ones to stay away...).

The file `robots.txt` must be positioned in the root of the website.

<iframe class = "robots-text" 
  src="{{ site.url }}/robots.txt"
  width = "200"
  height = "100"
>
</iframe>
